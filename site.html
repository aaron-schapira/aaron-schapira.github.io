					<p><br>Hello!</p>
					
					<p>I'm a first-year MSc student in Data Science for Decision Making 
            at Maastricht University, The Netherlands. I have a particular interest
            for Mathematics and Machine Learning for which I followed several courses
            throughout my curriculum.<p>
            
            <p> I completed my bachelor in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
              at Maastricht University as well. During my bachelor, I wrote a thesis 
              regarding Reinforcement Learning for energy market within a company. 
              The goal was to be able to use the fluctuations on the market to increase 
              the revenue from storing low cost energy and selling it at a higher cost, 
              with the help of a RL agent. This was a very good experience as I learned 
              about RL techniques such as online and offline Q learning, I also strengthened 
              my communication skills through interactions with the company. <p>

            <p><b>Republican vs Democrat Tweet classification</b> 
             his report describes algorithms that enable to clas-
                sify someoneâ€™s political opinion, more specifically,
                whether the person is Democrat or Republican.
                To analyse the data, the project focuses
                on several techniques such as preprocessing meth-
                ods and supervised classifiers (Naive Bayes, Logis-
                tic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-
                Nearest Neighbors and LSTM Neural Network).
                Eventually, this will lead to the conclusion that,
                indeed, a machine learning model is able to classify
                the political party of a politician following the tech-
                niques implemented in this paper. </p>
            
              <p><b>Algorithms for the game Abalon
                </b>(Supervised by Dr. Katharina Schuller):
                This project explores game-playing agent approaches
                for the board game Abalone. The project primarily focuses on op-
                timization and comparison of two tree search algo-
                rithms: MiniMax with Alpha-Beta pruning (called
                Alpha-Beta Tree Search - ABTS) and Monte-Carlo
                Tree Search (MCTS).

              <p><b>General Game Playing with a Portfolio Agent using Machine Learning and GGP add-ons
                </b>(Supervised by Dr. Eric Piette):
                General Game Playing requires an agent to play all
                types of games optimally. In the Kilothon competi-
                tion, an agent has to play over a thousand games,
                each with only one minute of thinking time. For
                this purpose, a portfolio agent is created, picking the
                best agent per game. Which agent should be selected
                for which game is determined by a machine learning
                model. This model was trained on a subset of the
                games as training on all games is not feasible. This
                subset was created by clustering games on their con-
                cepts and selecting representative samples from each
                cluster.
